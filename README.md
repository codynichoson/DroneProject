# Quadrotor Design and Control from Scratch

### Project by 
Davin Landry and Cody Nichoson

### Description
This project was completed as part of COMP_SCI 410 Quadrotor Design and Control at Northwestern University. The goal was to assemble, program, and test a small quadrotor from scratch as an exercise in mechatronics and controls. The quadrotor is capable of autonomous hovering and features several safety cut-offs triggered when certain criteria are met.
